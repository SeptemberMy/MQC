Welcome to MQC's documentation!
========================================
**My Quantum Chemistry(MQC)** is an open-source package based on  Ab-initio Quantum Chemistry(mainly) methods.This package aims to provide a simple and convenient platform for quickly implementing new theoretical  methods, which also can be a teaching tool (toy model) for beginners to learn Quantum Chemistry.

**MQC** is based on **Fortran90**. To maintain the readability,code is not parallel in principle,and should be consistent with formulas as much as possible. As a result,the efficiency may be low,but will remain within an acceptable range.
